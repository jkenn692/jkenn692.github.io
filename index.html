         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University majoring in Studio Arts. art has always been a part of my life. I tend to work in many different media of art. One media I have worked on for a majority of my life, is comic illustrating.</p>
         <p>
           For years I have developed and illustraded my character called Merlin and his friends.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I have found using art to communicate my everyday life through comics is much like keeping a diary. Creating Merlin and Friends has always been my way to bring others happiness
